## ðŸ‘‹ **We are Hiring!**

A number of ANU PhD Scholarships which provide a stipend are funded by Colleges. It is normal for recipients to undertake study on a full-time basis. However, in accordance with strict criteria, the scholarship can be awarded for part-time study. International scholars must undertake study on a full-time basis. Details can be found [**here**](https://www.anu.edu.au/study/scholarships/find-a-scholarship/anu-phd-scholarships).
