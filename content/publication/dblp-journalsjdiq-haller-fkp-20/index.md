abstract: Linked Open Data promises to provide guiding principles to publish
  interlinked knowledge graphs on the Web in the form of findable, accessible,
  interoperable, and reusable datasets. We argue that while as such, Linked Data
  may be viewed as a basis for instantiating the FAIR principles, there are
  still a number of open issues that cause significant data quality issues even
  when knowledge graphs are published as Linked Data. First, to define
  boundaries of single coherent knowledge graphs within Linked Data, a
  principled notion of what a dataset is, or, respectively, what links within
  and between datasets are, has been missing. Second, we argue that to enable
  FAIR knowledge graphs, Linked Data misses standardised findability and
  accessability mechanism via a single entry link. To address the first issue,
  we (i) propose a rigorous definition of a naming authority for a Linked Data
  dataset, (ii) define different link types for data in Linked datasets, (iii)
  provide an empirical analysis of linkage among the datasets of the Linked Open
  Data cloud, and (iv) analyse the dereferenceability of those links. We base
  our analyses and link computations on a scalable mechanism implemented on top
  of the HDT format, which allows us to analyse quantity and quality of
  different link types at scale.
