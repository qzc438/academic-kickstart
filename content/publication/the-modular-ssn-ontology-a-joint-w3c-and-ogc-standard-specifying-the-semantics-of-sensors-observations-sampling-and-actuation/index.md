abstract: "The joint W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) and OGC (Open Geospatial
  Consortium) Spatial Data on the Web (SDW) Working Group developed a set of
  ontologies to describe sensors, actuators, samplers as well as their
  observations, actuation, and sampling activities. The ontologies have been
  published both as a W3C recommendation and as an OGC implementation standard.
  The set includes a lightweight core module called SOSA (Sensor, Observation,
  Sampler, and Actuator) available at: http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/, and a more
  expressive extension module called SSN (Semantic Sensor Network) available at:
  http://www.w3.org/ns/ssn/. Together they describe systems of sensors and
  actuators, observations, the used procedures, the subjects and their
  properties being observed or acted upon, samples and the process of sampling,
  and so forth. The set of ontologies adopts a modular architecture with SOSA as
  a self-contained core that is extended by SSN and other modules to add
  expressivity and breadth. The SOSA/SSN ontologies are able to support a wide
  range of applications and use cases, including satellite imagery, large-scale
  scientific monitoring, industrial and household infrastructures, social
  sensing, citizen science, observation-driven ontology engineering, and the
  Internet of Things. In this paper we give an overview of the ontologies and
  discuss the rationale behind key design decisions, reporting on the
  differences between the new SSN ontology presented here and its predecessor
  [Web Semantics: Science, Services and Agents on the World Wide Web 17 (2012),
  25–32] developed by the W3C Semantic Sensor Network Incubator group (the
  SSN-XG). We present usage examples and describe alignment modules that foster
  interoperability with other ontologies."
